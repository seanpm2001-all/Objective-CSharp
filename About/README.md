# About Objective-C#

Objective-C# is a mixture of Objective-C and C# It is an experimental project that I currently don't have enough time and resources to devote to, and will be a community project. As like all my other projects, it will be Free and Open Source, Free as in free of price, AND freedom (digital rights/cyber rights, human rights, software rights)

## Syntax

Its syntax contains fused terms, such as NSLog becoming NSLog.println, and Objective-C keywords mixed with C# keywords. It is planned to be a dot net language that is designed to run on Linux, MacOS, Windows, and any other needed operating system.

## Shebang support

Objective-C# supports BASH Shell shebangs as well, with the standard language Shebang being `#!/bin/objective-csharp -x`

## File format

Objective-C# can either use the .mm or .cs file formats. Right now, for compatibility, the *.mm file format is recommended above all.
